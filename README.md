## Overview
Cross-Stitch Catalogue is an app designed for users to keep track of cross-stitch patterns they want to use, and the threads required for these patterns. Users are able to access a shopping list for all required threads, as well as sort through their patterns by project status. Itâ€™s basic design allows for use with other needlecrafts such as crochet, knitting, embroidery, needle-punch.

## About the User
In their enthusiasm, needlework crafters often stockpile supplies without following through in the projects they plan for. This app allows users to catalogue their patterns from any different sources (Etsy, DMC, Blogs) into one space. They are also able to save the corresponding threads required for these patterns - and keep track of if they already own the thread or if they still need to purchase it.

## Features
- The app requires user authentication to provide a personal experience for each user to catalogue the cross-stitch patterns they are interested in.
- The cross-stitch patterns can be sorted by project status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed)
- The user can create, edit, delete, and view more details for each pattern. 
- The user can add the threads required for each pattern, and can click an affordance to indicate that they own particular threads.
- The Shopping List view shows all threads that the user has indicated that they do not own.
